Chatbot can be created in a tool, but under the tool the logic used are:

AIML
ChatScript

etc. to input utterances https://chatbotsmagazine.com/deep-logic-for-support-ai-chatbots-c7fb83518c90
Question-answer pairs

Derive meaning from utterances [Natural Language]
-> find the corresponding answer

The difficulty here becomes building a decision tree for more complex problems
But this depends on the problem to solve
Eg. answer a question
or provide customer service

A conversation is more difficult
There are ways to fill in the conversation utterances via big databases of conversations
Cleverbot etc. This approach requires a large amount of data.
Results may vary, as those bots don't win prizes.
Hand-crafted convresation bots are still the state of the art, but require a lot of specialised writing 
It's an art form 


For our project, must build a decisiontree https://chatbotsmagazine.com/chatbot-decision-trees-a42ed8b8cf32
Game start
Game flow	Player flow

Apparently advanced services can have a lot of if-then logic that's impossible to hand-code
So Deep Logic Networks are used (oxford exvisory is a product made with that)

Our ChatBot's logic would be based on game theory
