Automate team work.
"Many Slack teams use Howdy to collect lunch orders, generate detailed progress reports, and make decision-making more transparent."
Botkit: "Botkit Studio came for an easier way to construct conversations and interactions outside code — very tedious to write everything outside code. CMS for scripts and conversational flows."

"Studio works with Botkit for conversation and flows. It also works with Wit, API.AI, and LUIS. NLP and hosting can be layers — all open source."

Recommends: QZ app for Quartz News - "they are doing interesting things with news delivery in a messaging style. Try it on the iPhone."

Growbot, "interesting tool"
"HBR bot for Slack is neat — it beams you news articles."

"Trello and Jira have Slack bot integrations that are decent"
Statsbot 
"Microsoft LUIS. API.AI is great for voice stuff."

"Bot builders should get set up with analytics tools as early as possible. There are many great options there. Dashbot, Botmetrics and Botanalytics are all solid. I have recently fallen in love with Glitch, which is something like Google Docs for javascript development. We use it to quickly host Botkit code for testing and fun."

"Tom Hadfield of Message.io — a friend, did a YC startup, really gets interoperability and translation layers between services.""
"Amir Shevat at Slack"
"Ted Livingston and Sergio Silva from Kik"
